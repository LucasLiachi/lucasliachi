Process Specialist with 8 years of experience in Technology, focused on operational excellence and digital transformation. Throughout my career, I have led the implementation of both agile and traditional methodologies, optimizing processes and practices that increased organizational efficiency across various sectors. In addition to my experience in Technology, I have also gained expertise in Quality Management Systems (QMS), Logistics, and Commerce.

ðŸŽ“ With a solid academic background and certifications in Lean Six Sigma, Kanban, and COBIT, I have implemented strategic solutions in Process Management and IT Governance, resulting in measurable improvements such as reduced operational costs and increased productivity.

ðŸ’¼ Currently, I lead End-to-End (E2E) process mapping and Value Chain analysis at Softplan, while also developing new strategic processes for Governance. I use key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor process effectiveness and ensure the delivery of results aligned with organizational goals. Previously, I provided specialized consulting in process mining, ERP implementations, and application lifecycle management (ALM) systems, helping companies gain greater control and accuracy over their operations through data analysis, process auditing, and continuous improvement.
